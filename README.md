A CMC style blog where users can view blog posts and comments.  If a user would like to participate they can create a free account and sign in to write posts of their own and comment on existing posts.  While logged in, users can also make edits to their own posts or choose to delete them.  Deleting the posts will delete any associated comments with them.  A great, simple communication tool!
